                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite great progress in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the field is still
                    struggling to ensure the robustness and fairness of models. So far, NLP has prioritized data
                    size over data quality. Yet there is growing evidence suggesting that the diversity of data, a
                    key dimension of data quality, is crucial for fair and robust NLP models. Many researchers are
                    therefore trying to create more diverse datasets, but there is no clear path for them to follow.
                    Even the fundamental question “How can we measure the diversity of a dataset? ” is currently
                    wide open. We still lack the tools and theoretical
                    insights to understand, improve, and leverage data diversity in NLP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DataDivers will 1) develop the first ever framework to measure data diversity in NLP datasets;
                    2) investigate how data diversity impacts NLP model behavior; and 3) develop novel approaches
                    that harness data diversity for fairer and more robust NLP models. We operationally define the
                    diversity of a text collection as the variability of texts along specific dimensions (e.g., semantic,
                    lexical, and sociolinguistic). Sociolinguistic diversity in particular, is an overlooked but crucial
                    dimension, which this project aims to address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DataDivers will break new ground by taking a comprehensive view of data diversity, which is
                    urgently needed for robust and fair NLP. Its approach will be both theoretical and empirical.
                    It will combine insights from disciplines that have developed methodologies to quantify data
                    diversity with rigorous empirical experimentation. DataDivers will take a unique view on data
                    diversity: measuring it at the dataset level, and across contexts for individual features. Finally,
                    DataDivers will use its framework to develop diversity-informed data collection and model
                    training methods.
